For computer brain
Issue with forks not being able to be blocked only can see winning moves tries to emulate doesn't know how
to emulate a blocking commands e.g. if player goes on edge have to play centre. To stop corner forks
Possible solution: randomise computer starting or player starting, which will have to change the code to say who started.
this could then see the player block the computers attempted fork. Then need to analyse the losing half of the data and
see what it could do different. Need algorithm to take into consideration winning position and desire to get there and
 block player but also the factor that made it lose, to avoid doing that again.
